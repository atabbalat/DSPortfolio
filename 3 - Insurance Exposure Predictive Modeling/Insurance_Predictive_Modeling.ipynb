    "Insurance is a highly complicated industry where a lot of factors must be considered in pricing a policy. Whether it's the home age, size, and even location. I have acquired a dataset for an insurance company that most of their business is placed in FL. The data contains many factors by policy. In addition, the dataset shows the total premium by policy as well as the reinsurance cost and the losses (claims).\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is going to be on the homeowner’s product for the FL policies in the dataset. Finding out the relationships of all the variables and determining what correlations exist. Going more specific, will add a few more variables which are determining the ratios of reinsurance cost and losses (claims) to the premium. By doing this, a model can be created on ratio ceilings to determine if certain policies could be priced differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main target here is to identify whether there are enough premiums going in the FL book of business to be an initial point for the company to make profits. That said, a combined ratio must be added. Therefore, a linear regression model will be implemented to compare with the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the variables that have expectations on correlation include would be like age of a house, I would expect the older the house is, the higher the premium should be because it is more likely to be damaged rather than a newer house. This is why a correlation exercise needs to happen in order to see how these variables correlate with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The charts below will identify a few things. First, proof that the FL business book shows the highest amount of total premiums. Another plot will be to focus on a scatter between the premiums and losses to determine if there are some outliers there. The concentration of premiums and how they are distributed based on house age. This will be a good exercise to streamline the data more and have better results."

    "There is a clear message here where the highest premiums are coming from new houses built between 2020 and 2018. The reinsurance cost on those are the highest but lower losses. Where as the other high point of premiums coming from in midpoint 2005 and have higher losses but lower reinsurance cost. This indicates that the new built houses would be located in higher risk zones for weather events which makes sense for the reinsurance cost to be higher. Yet, the homes built around 2005 year would have maintenance issues since its older causing higher amount of claims coming through.\n",

    "Since the results are almost identical to the linear regression done above, this proves out that the model will require more variables that arent in the dataset to give a more accurate prediction. In my opinion, just from experience and looking at the dataset used. Distance to cost of the home is a huge correlated variable that is necessary to be a part of the dataset to improve predictions of premiums. The Homeowners insurance industry is a very complex indusrty that requires a lot of variables to considered in order to build a prediction that could estimate a best fit cost based on historical data and market data as well.\n",

    "It makes sense to use a regression models on insurance data as it is used as of today mostly for predictions, the difficult part is the sweet spot of variables needed to be able to predict the data."
