# Neural Network Image Classification Project

This project focuses on using neural networks to classify images using the ResNet50 model. The project demonstrates image classification for different animal images.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the following Python packages:

- tensorflow
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Project Structure

The project is organized in a Jupyter Notebook and consists of the following sections:

1. **Imports**: Importing the necessary libraries for image classification using neural networks.

2. **Define a Function for Classifying an Image**: Defining a function that takes an image path as input, loads and preprocesses the image, uses the ResNet50 model to classify the image, and outputs the top predicted classes and their probabilities.

3. **Image Classification**: Classifying four different animal images (bear, elephant, koala, and ram) using the defined function. The images are loaded, displayed, classified, and the results are written to a file.

Please note that this README provides an overview of the project structure and the steps involved. For detailed explanations and code implementation, refer to the Jupyter Notebook file.
