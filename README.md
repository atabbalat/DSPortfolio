# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to this Data Science Portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects covering various aspects of data science, including data analysis, machine learning, recommendation systems, computer vision, and more. Each project demonstrates skills and expertise in different areas of data science.

## Projects

1. [Weather App](https://github.com/atabbalat/DSPortfolio/blob/master/1%20-%20WeatherApp/README.md): A Python application fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input of a city name or zip code. It displays weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

2. [COVID-19 Analysis Project](https://github.com/atabbalat/DSPortfolio/blob/master/2%20-%20Covid%20Analysis/README.md): Analysis of COVID-19 related data like cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population for each country. It involves data wrangling, storing data in a SQLite database, combining data using SQL JOIN operations, and creating visualizations.

3. [Insurance Predictive Modeling Project](https://github.com/atabbalat/DSPortfolio/blob/master/3%20-%20Insurance%20Exposure%20Predictive%20Modeling/README.md): A project focused on insurance predictive modeling using a dataset related to insurance premiums, losses, and building exposures. The goal is to analyze the data and build a linear regression model to predict insurance premiums based on various factors. The project involves data preprocessing, data visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

4. [Diabetes Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/atabbalat/DSPortfolio/blob/master/4%20-%20Diabetes%20Predictive%20Modeling/README.md): Involves predictive modeling for diabetes using various machine learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, handling outliers, model training and evaluation, and visualizing the results.

5. [Neural Network Image Classification](https://github.com/atabbalat/DSPortfolio/blob/master/5%20-%20Neural%20Network%20Image%20Classification/README.md): Utilizes neural networks, specifically the ResNet50 model, for image classification. It demonstrates the classification of animal images such as bears, elephants, koalas, and rams.

6. [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/atabbalat/DSPortfolio/blob/master/6%20-%20Movie%20Recommender%20App/README.md): A movie recommendation system built using collaborative filtering. It involves data preprocessing, creating user-item matrices, and calculating similarity between users or items to make personalized movie recommendations.

7. Project 7 (work in progress)
