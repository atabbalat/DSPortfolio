# Movie Recommender System Project

This project focuses on developing a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering implemented through the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. The project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user viewing history and preferences.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy

## Project Structure

The project is organized in a Python script and consists of the following sections:

1. **Imports**: Importing the necessary libraries for developing a movie recommender system.

2. **Data Loading**: Loading and inspecting the MovieLens dataset, which contains user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and duplicates, transforming the data into a format suitable for recommendation algorithms.

4. **Feature Selection**: Selecting the relevant features for the model, which are user ID, movie ID, and user ratings.

5. **Implementation**: Implementing Collaborative Filtering using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Testing the model with various movie inputs to evaluate the quality of recommendations it produces.

Please note that this README provides an overview of the project structure and the steps involved. For detailed explanations and code implementation, refer to the Python script file.
